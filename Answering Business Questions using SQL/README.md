# Answering Business Questions using SQL

### Project Description

In this project, we are working for an online record store and need to answer business questions by querying the store's data.

The project presents four scenarios where the store needs to make a business decision. Each scenario can be summarized by one of the following questions:

1. What are the top genres of tracks sold in the USA?
2. What is the number of total sales by employee?
3. What are sales by country and which have the opportunity for growth?
4. What percent of orders are album purchases vs. individual tracks?

To answer these questions and provide recommendations to the store, we use the SQLite package to query the store's database.

### Database

[Chinook.db](https://github.com/capvkd/portfolio/blob/master/Answering%20Business%20Questions%20using%20SQL/chinook.db) - the store's database, which follows the schema diagram below.
