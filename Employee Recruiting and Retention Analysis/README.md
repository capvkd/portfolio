# Employee Recruiting and Retention Analysis

### Problem Statement: 

We have been provided with the company’s data on the hiring in one market for the last year. This data shows the number of people hired in the market each month, the number retained each month thereafter, the average hours worked by these employee cohorts, and the average attendance in each cohort. We also know that the following techniques were used for the hiring efforts during these months:
April to July, October, February, and March – Digital ads only
August and September – Flyers only
November to January – Hiring events only

For this project, we are asked to answer the following questions:
1. Calculate the number of active employees each month, the average hours worked each month, and the average attendance each month.
2. Based on this data, and only this data, what is the average monthly churn and total annual churn of employees in this market?
3. If you had to decide between digital hiring, flyers, or hiring events, which strategy would you use? Why?
4. Assume the following employee acquisition cost, and calculate the total spend on hiring for the year.
    1. Digital ads - $200/employee
    2. Flyers - $10/employee
    3. Hiring Events - $1000/mo (regardless of number of hires)
