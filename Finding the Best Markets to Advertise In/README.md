### Fidning the Best Markets to Advertise In

## Project Intro

In this project, we are working for an e-learning company who is looking to invest in a marketing campaign. We are tasked with finding the two best markets for the company to focus their marketing efforts on.

## Assumtions:
- The products cost $100 per month
- The product is only available in the English language
- The company's main focus is web and development courses

## Available data:
- [2017-fCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv](https://github.com/capvkd/portfolio/blob/master/Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In/2017-fCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv): 2018 results for a survey of new coders conducted by freeCodeCamp, an e-learning platform with a large Medium publication.

## Project Steps
The first part of the project checks the data to confirm that it is representative of the population we're looking to analyze.

Once this is confirmed, we then work to narrow down the markets we do our analysis on, based on population density. For the sake of this project, each country represented in the data is its own market.
